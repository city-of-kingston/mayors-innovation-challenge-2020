  description: >-
    Kingston faces a series of complex challenges as we work toward our vision of becoming a smart,
    livable, 21st century city and is seeking solutions from student innovators.
    The Mayor's Innovation Challenge is a competition calling on teams of students from Kingston's
    major post-secondary institutions to develop innovative proposals to address an identified challenge
    faced by the City of Kingston. The City, in partnership with Queen's University, St. Lawrence College
    and the Royal Military College, has the honour of continuing to host this collaborative problem-solving
    platform and experiential learning opportunity for its second year.

    Teams may have a maximum of three students, at least 50 per cent of whom are currently enrolled in
    one of Kingston's post-secondary institutions. Teams will submit a single proposal outlining their
    innovative idea in one of four challenge categories. Proposals from all academic disciplines are
    welcome and multi-disciplinary proposals are encouraged. At least one member from each team must
    attend a workshop in order to qualify to submit an application. Extenuating circumstances will be
    considered on a case-by-case basis.
