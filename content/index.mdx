What is the Mayor's Innovation Challenge?
</div></ScrollHeader>

Kingston faces a series of complex challenges as we work toward our vision of becoming a smart, livable, 21st century city and is seeking solutions from student innovators. The Mayor's Innovation Challenge is a competition calling on teams of students from Kingston's major post-secondary institutions to develop innovative proposals to address an identified challenge faced by the City of Kingston. The City, in partnership with Queen's University, St. Lawrence College and the Royal Military College, has the honour of continuing to host this collaborative problem-solving platform and experiential learning opportunity for its second year.

This year's competition will include two separate challenge streams, each with a coveted prize. Current and recently graduated post-secondary students are eligible to submit proposals addressing one of four challenges outlined below:

**Dunin-Deshpande Smart Cities Stream**
- Smart Cities Challenge

**Public Sector Innovation Stream**
* Engaging Residents in Long-Term Care
* Revitalizing Public Spaces
* Reducing Carbon Emissions

The creators of the top submissions, selected by the Mayor and senior staff, will be invited to present their proposals at the Mayor's Innovation Challenge Pitch event on Friday, February 8.

The winning team of the Dunin-Deshpande Smart Cities Stream will receive a four-month paid internship with the Dunin-Deshpande Queen's Innovation Centre. As part of this experience, they will be granted $4,000 in seed capital for their idea, along with access to the Queen's Innovation Centre Summer Initiative (QICSI 2019) program to accelerate their innovation.

Winners from of the Public Sector Innovation Stream will receive a four-month paid internship with a municipal department with the City of Kingston. The winning team will be awarded an operating budget of $10,000 to implement their idea, and gain access to a full slate of resources and mentorship from City staff. The winning team will also be exposed to a variety of other projects underway at the City, and an opportunity to build skills and gain invaluable government experience, applicable in any career.
