# What is the Mayor's Innovation Challenge?

Kingston faces a series of complex challenges as we work toward our vision of becoming a smart,
livable, 21st century city and is seeking solutions from student innovators.
The Mayor's Innovation Challenge is a competition calling on teams of students from Kingston's
major post-secondary institutions to develop innovative proposals to address an identified challenge
faced by the City of Kingston. The City, in partnership with Queen's University, St. Lawrence College
and the Royal Military College, has the honour of continuing to host this collaborative problem-solving
platform and experiential learning opportunity for its second year.
