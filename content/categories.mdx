<AccordionItem title={`Public Sector Challenge 1: Demonstrating Leadership on Climate Action`}>

The City of Kingston is committed to environmental leadership and is challenging students to develop innovative ideas that will address the global climate emergency through local action. This challenge involves four potential focus areas for consideration: increase climate science literacy or awareness to boost climate action; electrification of transit and personal transportation; single-use plastics and litter reduction; and a local carbon-offset program.

**Supporting Information**

Given the economic, social and environmental threats of climate change and Kingston's 2019 declaration of a climate emergency, the City is committed to protecting the environment for future generations. As an internationally connected city, Kingston will address this global issue as a local climate action leader and inspire Kingston residents to become part of the solution.

The City will lead by example with measurable, effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions strategies, including building retrofits, eliminating municipally supplied single-use plastics and other energy efficiencies to become carbon neutral as soon as possible and no later than 2040. More immediately, these changes will result in a 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the City's operations by 2022. The City will continue to electrify its vehicle fleet, promote green development, energy production and active transportation, create well-maintained litter free roads, expand green spaces, protect wetlands, and promote more recycling and waste diversion. Action on climate change will protect the environment and those most vulnerable.

2018 Update on the Kingston Climate Action Plan.</a> 

<br>**Increase climate science literacy and awareness to boost climate action**<br/>
While the City of Kingston works to demonstrate leadership on climate action, it must be acknowledged that GHG emissions from municipal operations account for less than 2% of the entire carbon footprint of the City of Kingston. No matter what the City does to reduce emissions, we can’t reach our reduction targets without the help of citizens, institutions and businesses. When discussing climate science, misinformation or lack of information often inhibits constructive dialogue, and limits the uptake of climate action. How can the City increase climate science literacy across the community, lowering barriers to climate action for local businesses, organizations and individuals? How can awareness or social buy-in be accelerated through innovative approaches like gamification, service apps or other innovative approaches?

**Electrification of transit and transportation** 
The City of Kingston has made a serious commitment to prepare for the transition to electric vehicle (EV) adoption. Winning Canada’s inaugural Municipal Electric Champion Award based on EV strategy and initiative, the City now has installed 50 public EV charging stations in 21 locations. On May 8, 2019, a motion was passed to approve the purchase of two electric buses for use by Kingston Transit. Considering transportation is the second largest source of GHG emissions in Canada, how can we better improve and enhance EV transit and transportation in Kingston? What innovative or collaborative options can we consider for non-automotive transport, personal vehicles and shared transportation services?

**Single-use plastics and litter reduction** 
Single-use plastics (SUPs) are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. These are items such as plastic bags, straws, soft drink and water bottles, and most food packaging. The negative impact of SUPs has been widely reported, including the unsightliness of plastic litter on our roads, parks, and waterfronts, and harmful micro-plastics increasingly contaminating bodies of water and even the most remote animal habitats. These impacts on the natural environment can be reduced by replacing SUPs with materials which are highly reusable, compostable, or are more cost effective to recycle. How can we discourage the use of SUPs and/or reduce plastic waste and litter in Kingston?

**Local carbon-offset program** 
While many local businesses and organizations are taking steps to reduce GHG emissions, they may face many practical challenges in the transition towards carbon neutrality. Once an individual or business has worked to reduce their carbon footprint to their greatest ability within our current systems they may consider purchasing carbon offsets. Purchasing carbon offsets allows organizations, businesses and individuals to compensate for carbon emissions they may produce through the sequestering of carbon emissions through other means, and puts a price on the impact of GHG emissions. However, many carbon offset schemes take action to sequester carbon emissions through frivolous means or in places far removed from the Kingston community rendering a less tangible local impact. However, carbon offsets purchased in Kingston could lead to a direct impact within the community and boosting consumer efficacy and   leading to the greater adoption of this practice. How can the City of Kingston or other organizations provide a carbon offset program that directly impacts the local environment?

<AccordionItem title={`Public Sector Challenge 2: Revitalizing public spaces`}>

The City of Kingston is calling on students to outline a feasible ‘reimagining' of a public space. Using the concepts of placemaking and tactical urbanism, how could the City propose redesigning one of its public spaces into a welcoming, interactive, attractive, and pedestrian-friendly experience?

**Supporting Information**

A variety of approaches can be used to revitalize and beautify public spaces for community use. The concept of placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential to create public spaces that promote sociability, health, happiness, and well-being. The approach of tactical urbanism often involves experimenting with a collection of low-cost, temporary changes and interventions to the built environment to enhance spaces for community use that may eventually be transformed in more permanent ways based on what is learned Action-driven, these approaches can be city, organizational, and/or citizen-led efforts to neighbourhood building and can shift how communities think about collaboration and urban change.  Some examples include, but are not limited to:

- Temporary public art installations that invite interaction
- Scheduled street closures for community events and/or new uses for the space
- Reshaping a space for programming opportunities
- Installing temporary fixtures/furniture to increase accessibility and use  of an underutilized space
- Use of vacant storefronts for cultural and community events

<AccordionItem title={`Public Sector Challenge 3: Reducing carbon emissions`}>

The City of Kingston is challenging students to develop innovative solutions to reduce carbon emissions in our community. This challenge involves three potential focus areas for consideration:

- Electric Vehicle Adoption
- Single-use Plastics Reduction
- Community Bikeshare Optimization

<br/>

**Supporting Information**

Climate change is one of the most significant global threats to our quality of life. Our children and our grandchildren's economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being hinges on our ability to take action and realize sustained greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. It will take all of us working together at a global, national and community level to effect the change that is needed.

In 2014, Council endorsed its first [Kingston Climate Action Plan] (https://www.cityofkingston.ca/documents/10180/23938974/COU_A0718-18048.pdf/63cf352d-419b-4c0c-aa17-5502ca56510e) (KCAP) and set out targets for reducing community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 15% and 30% by 2020 and 2030 respectively. Since that time, municipal departments, local businesses, institutions, community organizations and residents have undertaken many initiatives that, in conjunction with the greening of Ontario's electrical supply, have contributed to reducing community emissions by 12% as of 2015.

###### **Single-use plastics reduction**
Single-use plastics, or disposable plastics, are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. These are items like plastic bags, straws, coffee stirrers, soft drink and water bottles and most food packaging. How can we discourage the use of single-use plastics and/or reduce single-use plastic waste and litter through various initiatives, educational campaigns, policies, or otherwise?

###### **Community bikeshare optimization**
A community bike-share program is a system of bicycles available for short-term rental that allows users to pick up a bicycle at one location and drop it off at another. The system used in Kingston is provided through a license to a private service provider (Dropbike Mobility Inc.) and is "dockless" or "stationless", meaning the bike-share system has no physical pay stations, but instead has designated zones or racks (called havens) where bikes will be placed and locked, ready for the next rider. Payments for bicycle use are made through a smartphone app.

How can the City optimize the placement of bikes and havens to ensure maximum ridership and convenience for users? How can the City, together with its bike share service provider, offer additional levels of service, technology or products to better promote the system as an alternative to automobile usage?
