### Submission Information

There are no specific restrictions or requirements for submissions - use your creativity and tell us what makes your proposed project the ideal solution. It is strongly recommended that you provide a thorough breakdown of how you will use the $10,000 toward implementing the project if you choose any of the categories in Stream 2, the Public Sector Innovation Challenge.
