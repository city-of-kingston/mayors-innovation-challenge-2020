### Submission Information

There are no specific restrictions or requirements for submissions - use your creativity and tell us what makes your proposed project the ideal solution. It is strongly recommended that you provide a thorough breakdown of how you will use the $10,000 toward implementing the project if you choose any of the categories in stream 2, the Public Sector Innovation Challenge. While we want you to think big, the project needs to be feasible. Please review the evaluation criteria before designing and submitting your proposal below.
